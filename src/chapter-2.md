Understanding Supply Chain Visibility
==============================================

Supply chain visibility is a critical component of supply chain management. In this chapter, we will explore the concept of supply chain visibility, traditional approaches to achieving it, and the limitations and challenges associated with those approaches.

Overview of Supply Chain Visibility
-----------------------------------

Supply chain visibility refers to the ability to track goods and information as they move through the supply chain, from raw materials to finished products. By achieving supply chain visibility, businesses can gain real-time insights into their supply chain operations, identify inefficiencies and bottlenecks, and respond quickly to changing market conditions.

Traditional Approaches to Supply Chain Visibility
-------------------------------------------------

Traditionally, businesses have used manual processes, such as spreadsheets and phone calls, to track goods and information in the supply chain. More recently, businesses have adopted electronic data interchange (EDI) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems to automate some of these processes. However, these approaches are often limited in their ability to provide real-time visibility into the supply chain, particularly when it comes to tracking goods that are in transit.

Limitations and Challenges of Traditional Approaches
----------------------------------------------------

Traditional approaches to supply chain visibility have several limitations and challenges, including:

* Limited data accuracy: Manual processes are prone to errors, which can lead to inaccurate data and suboptimal decision-making.

* Lack of real-time visibility: Traditional approaches often rely on batch processing, meaning data is only updated periodically rather than in real-time.

* Poor data integration: Traditional approaches may involve multiple systems that do not communicate well with each other, leading to data silos and inefficiencies.

* Inability to track goods in transit: Traditional approaches often struggle to provide real-time visibility into goods that are in transit, which can make it difficult to respond quickly to disruptions or delays.

Conclusion
----------

In conclusion, supply chain visibility is a critical component of supply chain management. While traditional approaches such as manual processes and EDI/ERP systems have been used to achieve visibility in the past, they often fall short in providing real-time visibility and accurate data. By understanding the limitations and challenges associated with traditional approaches, businesses can better identify the need for modern, AI-based solutions that enable greater transparency and traceability in their supply chain operations.
