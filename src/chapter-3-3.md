Case Studies on the Use of AI in Supply Chain Visibility
=====================================================================================================================

In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly applied in supply chain management to enhance visibility, automate routine tasks, and make more informed decisions. In this chapter, we will explore some case studies on the use of AI in supply chain visibility.

Case Study 1: Walmart's Use of Blockchain Technology for Food Traceability
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Walmart has been a pioneer in using blockchain technology to enhance transparency and traceability in its supply chain. By leveraging blockchain technology, Walmart can track the origin and movement of food products through its supply chain, enabling it to quickly identify potential issues and remove contaminated products from its shelves.

Case Study 2: UPS's Use of Predictive Analytics for Route Optimization
----------------------------------------------------------------------

UPS has been using predictive analytics to optimize its delivery routes for several years. By analyzing data on traffic patterns, weather conditions, and other factors, UPS can identify the most efficient routes for its delivery trucks, reducing transportation costs and improving delivery times.

Case Study 3: Maersk's Use of IoT Sensors for Container Tracking
----------------------------------------------------------------

Maersk, one of the world's largest shipping companies, has been using IoT sensors to track the location and condition of containers in transit. By leveraging these sensors, Maersk can gain real-time insights into its supply chain operations, identify potential issues, and respond quickly to disruptions.

Case Study 4: Nestle's Use of Machine Learning for Demand Forecasting
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Nestle, a leading global food and beverage company, has been using machine learning algorithms to forecast demand for its products. By analyzing data on consumer behavior, weather patterns, and other factors, Nestle can anticipate future demand for its products, enabling it to optimize inventory levels and reduce waste.

Conclusion
