Traditional Approaches to Supply Chain Visibility
=================================================================================================

Traditional approaches to supply chain visibility involve tracking the movement of goods and information through manual processes, spreadsheets, and legacy systems. In this chapter, we will explore some of the key traditional approaches to supply chain visibility.

Manual Processes
----------------

Manual processes are one of the most common traditional approaches to supply chain visibility. This involves using paper-based forms and manually entering data into spreadsheets or other systems. While this approach is simple and low-cost, it can be time-consuming and error-prone, especially when dealing with large volumes of data.

Spreadsheets
------------

Spreadsheets are another common traditional approach to supply chain visibility. This involves using tools such as Microsoft Excel to track inventory levels, shipments, and other supply chain activities. While this approach is familiar to many businesses and easy to implement, it can be challenging to scale and prone to errors if not properly maintained.

Legacy Systems
--------------

Legacy systems are often used by businesses to manage their supply chain operations. These systems may have been developed in-house or purchased from third-party vendors, and they may be outdated and difficult to integrate with modern technologies. While these systems may be familiar to businesses, they can be expensive to maintain and upgrade, and they may lack the functionality needed for effective supply chain visibility.

Conclusion
----------

In conclusion, traditional approaches to supply chain visibility involve manual processes, spreadsheets, and legacy systems. While these approaches may be familiar to businesses and easy to implement, they have several limitations, including a lack of real-time data, siloed systems, limited data analysis capabilities, and high costs. By embracing new technologies such as AI-based supply chain visibility solutions, businesses can overcome these limitations and achieve greater transparency, traceability, and efficiency in their supply chain operations.
