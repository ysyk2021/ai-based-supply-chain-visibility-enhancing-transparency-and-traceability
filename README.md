Supply chain management is a complex and challenging task that requires businesses to effectively manage multiple stakeholders across various stages of the supply chain, including suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and customers. One of the key challenges in supply chain management is achieving transparency and traceability, particularly as global supply chains become increasingly complex and interconnected.

AI-based supply chain visibility offers significant potential for enhancing transparency and traceability in supply chain management. By leveraging artificial intelligence technologies such as machine learning, natural language processing, robotics, and deep learning, businesses can gain real-time insights into their supply chain operations, automate routine tasks, and make more informed decisions.

The objectives of this book are to provide an overview of AI-based supply chain visibility, explore its applications in supply chain management, and provide guidance on implementing and scaling up these solutions. The book is structured to cover the different aspects of AI-based supply chain visibility, including data collection and analysis, the types of AI utilized, implementation strategies, future trends and challenges, and more.

This book is intended for supply chain professionals, logistics managers, business leaders, and anyone interested in exploring the potential of AI-based supply chain visibility. By carefully evaluating the potential benefits and risks of AI-based solutions and proactively addressing challenges related to data quality, integration, regulatory compliance, cost-effectiveness, and ethical considerations, businesses can successfully implement and scale up AI-based supply chain visibility solutions and achieve their business objectives.
